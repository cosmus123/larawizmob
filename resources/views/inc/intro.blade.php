  						<p>Wiz Mobile has earned an exalted place in app development history by achieving the rare trifecta of delivering a high quality app on time, within budget, and according to spec. And the CEO Raj Sanghvi made it all a pleasant experience. I highly recommend Wiz Mobile for software development.</p>

  						<p>We’ve been very pleased with the apps that Bitcot has developed. Historically, we’ve kept all development in-house, but on a whim we decided to give Bitcot a chance. The first few apps the developed were very solid. Production time was fast and the final apps are very stable. We’ve now decided to expand the line of apps that we’ll have them build for us.</p>
