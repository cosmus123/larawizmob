        It could not be easier! If you have a website, all it takes is a few clicks to set up your app, with no technical knowledge required. It’s a simple process of choosing a name for your app, choosing an icon, adding contact details, and then choosing a plan. We then get in touch with you once your app is live.

        Exactly what is on your website - look at this app as an extension of your existing digital presence. My Mobile App will ‘appify your website’, adding call and location functionality, as well as push notification capabilities, but at the end of the day your app is your website evolved. If you want to change the content within the app, make the change on your mobile website and your app will sync automatically.

        Your app content automatically updates whenever the website does. Whether it is one small price change, a new video added or an entire new section, whatever happens on your site is mirrored in your app. This happens automatically and should be almost instantaneous, although it may sometimes require the app to be shut down and re-opened for a complete app content update.

        Every single update made to your app or to how your app is displayed in the app stores must again go through the approval process. This can take up to 2 weeks at times (but is generally much quicker!).
